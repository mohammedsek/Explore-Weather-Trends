# Explore-Weather-Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project I

Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

What Software Do I need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

SQL
Excel
Extracting Data
To start I wrote an SQL query to retrieve all the temperature data from:

Local Database (Abu Dhabi)
Global Database
Upon retrieving the data, it was extracted on a CSV file for further evaluation.

Data Selection & Manipulation
Once the data has been extracted on CSV, it was possible to further evaluate the data on Excel. To provide a more accurate and useful dataset for comparison a range of the common years only was chosen.

Moreover, due to fluctuations in yearly averages, the data was evaluated considering moving averages (7-years) to provide smoother results during data visualization.

Data Visualization
Once the dataset was ready, it was time to plug n play. The first chart shows a comparison between the global and local temperature set across the years.
